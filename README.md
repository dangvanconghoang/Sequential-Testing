Sequential Sample Size Estimator:

This project provides a Python-based implementation of a Sequential Sampling method to calculate the minimum required sample size for A/B testing experiments, using likelihood-ratio-based stopping criteria.

Sequential tests allow for early stopping of experiments when statistical evidence is strong enough â€” potentially reducing cost and experiment duration compared to traditional fixed-sample-size methods.
